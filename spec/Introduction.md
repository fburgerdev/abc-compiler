# Introduction

# Purpose

The abc language serves an educational purpose. The design and development should teach me, and potentially others, about programming languages and their design as well as about building compilers.

# Philosophy

The abc language is designed and intended to be used similarly to C / C++.

The core principles, in no particular order, are the following:

- Aesthetics - The source code should be visually appealing
- Performance -  The program should have performance similar to C / C++ programs
- Simplicity - The languages ruleset should be concise and easy to understand. Itâ€˜s syntax should be expressive
