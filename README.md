# abc-compiler
This repo is a compiler for the `abc` language, a c++ like language created by me.

Both the language and the compiler were created for fun, as well as to learn about designing programming languages and building compilers.

## The abc-language

- [Types](spec/Types.md)
- [Generics](spec/Generics.md)
- [Definitions](spec/Definitions.md)
- [Statements](spec/Statements.md)
- [Expressions](spec/Expressions.md)
- [Memory Management](spec/Memory%20Management.md)
- [Built-In](spec/Built-In.md)

## Purpose
The abc language serves an educational purpose. The design and development should teach me, and potentially others, about programming languages and their design as well as about building compilers.

## Philosophy
The abc language is designed and intended to be used similarly to C/C++.

The core principles, in no particular order, are the following:
- Aesthetics - The source code should be visually appealing.
- Performance -  The program should have performance similar to C/C++ programs.
- Simplicity - The languages ruleset should be concise and easy to understand. Itâ€˜s syntax should be expressive.
