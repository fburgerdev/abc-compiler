# abc-compiler
This repo is a compiler for the `abc` language, a c++ like language created by me.

Both the language and the compiler were created for fun, as well as to learn about designing programming languages and building compilers.

The abc languages specification can be found [here](https://adaptable-roadrunner-a84.notion.site/spec-10e0c7c744d7805fbee7dfc1575d3596).
